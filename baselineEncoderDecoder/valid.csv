"Are you into any super heroes? My favorite is Superman! I'm not into super heroes but know that for Batman, his figures have been made since the 1940s. Oh really? I actually saw the recent Wonder Woman film and got into the superhero genre. You do know her right? I know that she's a fictional superhero and is featured in comics that DC Comics publish. Yeah, I think she's great but Superman definitely sets the standard for all superheroes I think. Indeed, he established primacy in American comics and assisted in making the archetype for superheroes. What else do you like about Superman? I feel like he is the epitome of the perfect superhero. That's why I am so fanatical about him. Not about liking him per se but did you know he was created by high school students from Ohio in 1933? No way? That's really early and crazy to think some teens thought of him! Speaking of which, I have some highschool friends who's into Magneto, do you know about him?","From what I know, he's the antagonist to the X-Men, and is featured in a lot of the ""X-Men"" franchise media adaptions."

"I like baking, it is my favorite hobby. That's great! Bread is the most commonly baked item? Do you bake that? I haven't made my own bread, it seems like it is a lot of work to do. Ah, OK. A person who bakes for a living is called a baker. Yeah, that's right. I'm not a pro, though. I'm terrible at creating cakes, I can bake them, but I'm not good at creative stuff. I understand. As for the process of baking, it involves heat being transferred from the surface to the interior of a baked good. Yeah, with a little patience added in as well because it takes time.","Interesting. Once the heat does its work, it leaves a dry, firm crust and a soft center."
