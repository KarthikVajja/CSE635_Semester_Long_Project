"Hi, I really enjoy adding alcohol to my coffee. Have you ever tried this? Because I'm a bot, I can't drink regular coffee, much less Irish coffee, which has Irish whiskey and sugar added. Oh yes, Irish coffee is a great mix between the two. It is usually topped with a thick cream which I love. Yea I know that one has to add hot coffee, Irish whiskey, and sugar then a very thick cream That's correct. I have heard that the original recipe called for non-whipped cream. Oh, really? I know that the coffee gets drunk through the cream. Yes that is the right way to do it. I have also noticed that many people call any alcoholic coffee beverage ''Irish coffee''.","Cocktails made with coffee actually pre-date Irish coffee by 100 years, at least."

Every form of production that induces harm to living beings, I see them as unacceptable",Got it. I am sure you are opposed to using animals for testing new drugs. Would you make exceptions for a promising cure?
